# JBC Controller v3.x
v3.x series is the follow-up for the successful v2.x controllers; released in 2018. It brings hardware and software upgrades, performance and UX optimizations. Starting with this version, everything is mounted to one, single-side load PCB; we're able to eliminate cabling and carrier hardware. This "front panel assembly" approach and DFM changes substantially optimized the assembly and testing procedures. 

It only supports JBC C245 tips. Hakko support is dropped and moved to its own PCB. AC version is no longer offered as standard but it is available as a special order.

v3.x introduces stand/holder detection feature. v3.0 to 3.2 supports hardware switched (typically a microswitch) stands.

Starting from v3.3 both microswitch and electrical detection are supported. Also the cartridge is now hard grounded due to popular request. 

v3.31 is the current version of this series.
